### Problem Statement

With rising resale flat prices, affordable public housing has become a concern to new homeowners. According to an annual wellness survey conducted by OCBC bank, 56% of Singaporeans who are in their 20s are worried that they cannot afford a home. 

As many aspiring homeowners will be financing their homes using their CPF savings, knowing the price of the HDB resale flat that they wish to purchase can help them better plan their finances and CPF contributions. 

So, how can the CPF Board assist these potential homeowners?

This project explores the key features that affect HDB resale prices in Singapore using data science methodologies. The objective is to build and deploy a reliable HDB resale price calculator that is intuitive and easy for potential homeowners to use, to help them understand what could be the resale price of their desired flat based on the key features.

### Conclusion

- A Linear Regression model is trained with 9 key features, where 89% of the variations in resale price can be explained by the features, with ±$48000 price difference.
- These features include: transaction year, floor area, age of HDB, full flat type, nearest distance to MRT, nearest distance to mall, postal sector, distance to CBD, and mid storey.
- With this model, a HDB resale price calculator is developed, allowing potential homebuyers to easily predict the price of their desired resale flat.

### Recommendations

1. Improve prediction score
 - Explore other factors (e.g. impact of cooling measures on resale price)
 - Explore other machine learning models

2. User Testing
- Test and improve app usability with focus groups

3. Public Launch
- Campaign launch to educate housing finance planning with calculation.
